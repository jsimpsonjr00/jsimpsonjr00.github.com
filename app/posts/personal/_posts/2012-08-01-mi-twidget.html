summary: "A prototype service for custom embeddable and sharable fully interactive Twitter widgets
with a Drag and Drop designer. Back end written in Java on Google App Engine, while the 
front end is a mix of Dojo Toolkit and jQuery. Unfortunately, Due to changes in the Twitter API 
and retirement of @Anywhere MiTwidget no longer functions. At this time there are no plans to
revive the project."
