This pair of Pioneer 3 way speakers with a 12" driver saw a good deal of action during the early 90s, but were 
retired in favor of a pair of bookshelf speakers long ago. All they've really done since is take up AC storage 
space. Wood grain finish with black speaker cover snap ons. Big, loud, inexpensive.
