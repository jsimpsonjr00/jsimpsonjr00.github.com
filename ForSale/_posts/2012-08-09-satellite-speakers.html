Long ago I purchased these as part of a computer surround sound set. They always sounded really good, but over time
the volume control cable developed a short. Unable to repair or replace the faulty cable the set was replaced. I kept
these little things around for use with another system and even used them as low volume options on a home stereo for a
short time. I no longer have a place for them, but someone might like them.
