This stereo system includes a Kenwood stereo receiver, Kenwood 5 disc CD changer and as a bonus a Pioneer dual cassette 
deck. Very good core system to build a home stereo around, but you'll need to supply speakers or perhaps pick up one
of the sets I have for sale. Lightly used, always stored in AC.
